          Western Port and Bass Strait. The sand hills and coastal hinterland <br>
          provide wonderful examples of links, resort and traditional courses. Visitors are <br>
          always welcome.​</p>
      <br>

          outdoor hot springs bath experience.​ <br>
          Activities include reflexology treatments, foot and hand baths, sauna, steam baths, <br>
          cold plunges and yoga. The cafe at the bath house provides light meals and <br>

        <br>
      <h3> Queenscliff Sorrento Ferry</h3>
      <br>
        <p>There's no better way to cross the Bay either with your car or as a foot passenger. <br>
          It only takes 40 minutes. Spot the playful dolphins whilst enjoying a coffee and light <br>
          refreshments. The ferries run every day of the year on the hour. Wonderful <br>
