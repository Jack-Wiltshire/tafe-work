    <h2> A bit about us </h2>
    <br>
    <p> On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.<br>
      Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township<br>
      of Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It<br>
      is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the<br>
      ocean beaches and surf.​<br>
      <br>
      Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite<br>
      overlooking a sun drenched, tree-filled private garden.<br>
      <br>
      A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable.  A<br>
      queen sized bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you<br>
      to relax and unwind.<br>
      <br>
      Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy!  An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty<br>
      of space to stretch out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.<br>
      This is the perfect place for a home away from home.​</p>

    <h2> Testimonials </h2>
    <br>
    <p><q>Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt.  Thank you.</q> <br>
      <q>So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!</q>​ <br>
      <q>This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing</q> <br>
      <q>What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it <br>
        and will return again and again.</q>​ <br>
        <q>Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive <br>
        back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!</q>​ <br>
        <q>Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!</q>​</p>
